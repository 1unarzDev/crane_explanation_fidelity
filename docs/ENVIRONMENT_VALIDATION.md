# Environment Validation

Validation status is split between submission-critical work and retained infrastructure. Historical
results remain in `docs/EXPERIMENTS.md`; this file is the living gate summary.

## Gate definitions

- `STRUCTURAL_PASS`: no missing scripts/assets, invalid roots/transforms, or duplicate semantic IDs.
- `PHYSICS_PASS`: floor support, collision, openings, and intended blockage behave correctly.
- `SENSOR_PASS`: spawn, TF, odometry, ROS, and configured sensors/frames pass their contract.
- `NAVIGATION_PASS`: predefined routes produce the required nontrivial path/obstacle interaction.
- `INTERACTIVE_PASS`: representative views and controls are visually inspected and usable.
- `HEADLESS_PASS`: canonical geometry, semantics, physics, sensors, and navigation retain their
  contract without presentation/UI.
- `EXPLANATION_READY`: scenario, route, objects, actions, and physical events have stable identities
  and separated robot-visible/evaluator-only evidence.
- `PARTIAL`: some gates pass, but the environment is not ready for the declared use.
- `BLOCKED`: a recorded external or technical blocker prevents the gate from running.

A successful short goal does not establish a representative route. Topic/service delivery does not
establish controller consumption. An unexpected outcome is retained as observed and is never
relabeled to satisfy a gate.

## Submission-critical validation

| Environment | Structural | Physics | Sensor | Navigation | Interactive | Headless | Explanation | Current verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frozen controlled TurtleBot3 corridor | Passed in retained runs | Passed for controlled layouts/interventions | Passed for ROS, LiDAR, odometry/TF, costmap observation | Passed for frozen recovery-success and terminal-abort families | Not required by frozen protocol | Passed | Passed for frozen F/G/H capture contract | Active frozen collection; do not change protocol |
| Warehouse/industrial ecological world | Primitive layers/IDs previously checked | Basic collision and short-route support checked | Short TurtleBot3 Nav2 smoke passed | **PARTIAL:** no validated multi-route/detour/blockage suite | **PARTIAL / NOT_RUN** for required inspection tooling | Basic smoke passed | **PARTIAL:** semantics exist; ecological route/event contracts incomplete | Active highest-priority environment work |
| Configurable proving ground | Corridor/blocker components exist | Timed blocker and mobility interventions checked | Existing land sensor/ROS path checked | **PARTIAL:** requested staggered/slalom/gate/U-trap/alternate-route layouts absent | **NOT_RUN** | Existing corridor path passed | **PARTIAL:** intervention IDs exist; general scenario manifests absent | Active second priority |
| RoboBoat ecological demonstration | Parallel workstream | Parallel workstream | Parallel workstream | Parallel workstream | Parallel workstream | Aquatic runtime requires graphics | Parallel workstream | **PARALLEL / OWNED ELSEWHERE** |

Active land development should move warehouse/proving-ground rows toward `NAVIGATION_PASS` and
`EXPLANATION_READY`, with explicit per-route results and artifact references.

## Retained infrastructure validation

| Environment | Retained result | Missing full validation | Submission status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1TENTH Spielberg | Deterministic conversion plus structural/physics/headless qualification | Full-lap ROS navigation and source-simulator comparison | Retained; not active priority |
| Clearpath pipeline | Offline source/geometry/layer/contact validation plus local 1 m ROS/Nav2 sensor/motion smoke | Representative route, calibrated route catalog, native Gazebo comparison, controller-consumption evidence | `DEFERRED_POST_SUBMISSION` unless immediately required by land study |
| PX4 walls/ArUco/windy | Structural/physics/raycast/directional-response infrastructure checks | SITL/ROS navigation, camera detection, explanation evaluation, calibrated equivalence | `DEFERRED_POST_SUBMISSION` |
| RoboSub pool/underwater assets | Existing simulation infrastructure retained | Submission-quality autonomy, sensors/evidence, navigation routes, and explanation evaluation | `DEFERRED_POST_SUBMISSION` |

Existing aerial/underwater accomplishments remain valid within their recorded scopes. Deferral means
their missing navigation/explanation gates will not consume pre-submission time; it does not convert
past passes into failures.

## Batch result target

The environment validator should eventually emit one record per world/route containing environment
and asset hashes, scenario manifest hash, semantic/collider inventory, robot compatibility, sensor
checks, route outcome/path metrics, contacts, interactive screenshot references, headless result,
and explicit gate values. Until that aggregate schema exists, each gate must cite its retained
command/result in `docs/EXPERIMENTS.md` and must not infer unexecuted gates from adjacent tests.
